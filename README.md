Web Development 1 - Assignment 1 Using HTML and CSS
For my assignment, I decided to create a website centered around the ketogenic diet, a personal interest of mine, using only HTML and CSS for the design and layout. This assignment allowed me to explore the basics of web development while focusing on a topic that I am intrested in. The site includes sections on about the ketogenic diet, the keto regime, keto friendly recipes, and guides on supplements, all designed with an emphasis on ease of use, not the best design (this is the best of my knowledge and skills so far that I have learned), sticking to the project's guidelines of utilizing only HTML and CSS.

In my assignment, I used Flexbox to design the navigation bar and applied CSS Grid for arranging the content sections. This approach allowed me to experiment with these two powerful layout techniques for a clean and structured website design.
