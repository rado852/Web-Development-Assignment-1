            The Regime outlines Low Carb High Fat (LCHF) dietary regimen, blending elements of the ketogenic diet with modern nutritional strategies for 
            weight loss and health. It emphasizes minimizing insulin secretion and detoxifying the body, advocating for reduced carbohydrate intake in favor of natural fats.
            The regimen involves eating two meals a day, excluding breakfast to align with the body's natural cycles of acceptance, assimilation, and excretion. 
            Additionally,the regime incorporates periodic fasting, fish days for health benefits, and advises against counting calories.
            Instead, it promotes eating until satiated, without overeating, and tailoring food intake based on physical activity levels. 
            The diet excludes sugar, high-carb foods like pasta and bread, and certain fruits, while recommending meat, fish, dairy (if tolerated), and vegetables. 
            The regime suggests monitoring personal responses to dairy and adjusting intake accordingly, emphasizing the importance of listening to one's body and adjusting 
            the diet to suit individual needs and health conditions.<br><br><br>
