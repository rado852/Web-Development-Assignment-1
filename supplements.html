            <h2>Keto Supplements</h2>
            <p>Supplements are often recommended on a ketogenic diet to address nutritional gaps and support overall health.
            Because the diet restricts certain food groups, it might lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients.
            Supplements like magnesium, potassium, and omega-3 fatty acids can help balance electrolytes, support heart health, and reduce inflammation.
            Additionally, vitamin D and fiber supplements might be necessary for bone health and digestive wellness, respectively.
            It's important to tailor supplement use to individual needs and consult with your doctor for personal advice.

            <h2>Supplements to Take</h2>
            <p>1. Electrolytes (Magnesium, Potassium, Sodium): To prevent imbalances due to reduced carb intake.<br>
                2. Omega 3 Fatty Acids: To support heart health and counteract inflammation.<br>
                3. Vitamin D: Often needed due to limited sun exposure or dietary intake.<br>
                4. Fiber: To aid digestion and maintain gut health, given the lower intake of high carb fruits and vegetables.<br>
                5. MCT Oil: Provides direct energy source and helps maintain ketosis.<br>
                6. Calcium: Supports bone health, especially important as some dairy products might be limited.<br>
                7. Exogenous Ketones: May help induce ketosis faster or provide energy for those already in ketosis.<br>
                8. B Vitamins: Particularly B12 and folate, for energy and to make up for potential deficiencies from limited grain consumption.<br>
                9. Iron: Especially for individuals not consuming much red meat, to prevent anemia.<br>
                10. Probiotics: To support gut health, beneficial due to changes in diet affecting gut flora.<br>
